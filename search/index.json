[{"content":"Intro These are my favorite Window manager(WM) utilities. They will help you switch from the traditional Desktop Environments(DE).\nSo, without further a due let\u0026rsquo;s begin.\nTerminal I know it\u0026rsquo;s a no-brainer, but a terminal is a key component of a WM setup. So, a great Terminal means a great Window manager session.\nGreat GNU/Linux Terminals:\n Alacritty. My favorite Terminal Emulator Kitty. Terminator. Konsole. Gnome Terminal.  Installation For Debian/Ubuntu\nsudo apt install \u0026lt;Terminal name\u0026gt; For Arch Linux\nsudo pacman -S \u0026lt;Terminal name\u0026gt; Xrandr/Arandr Xrandr for those who don\u0026rsquo;t know is a Terminal based program that sets up your monitor/s. However, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to use it in order to set up your monitors if you don\u0026rsquo;t like Terminal based tools. This is where Arandr comes in its a GUI front end for Xrandr, it has a great feature that when you configured your monitor/s correctly you can export the configuration as a script. This is great, this means that you can include it in your WM autostart script and it automatically sets your monitor/s correctly like if you were running a DE.\n Note: arandr requires xrandr, so you can install both by installing arandr.  Installation For Debian/Ubuntu\nsudo apt install arandr For Arch Linux\nsudo pacman -S arandr Rofi/Dmenu Both Rofi and Dmenu are great replacements for the DE launcher and application\u0026rsquo;s menu. Both applications do the same thing, and both also have many features that if you use them to their fullest you will always prefer them over the DE launcher and menu.\nInstallation For Debian/Ubuntu\nsudo apt install rofi sudo apt install dmenu For Arch Linux\nsudo pacman -S rofi sudo pacman -S dmenu Nitrogen It\u0026rsquo;s a great minimal wallpaper setter for GNU/Linux Operating System. it\u0026rsquo;s fast, lightweight, no-frills application.\nInstallation For Debian/Ubuntu\nsudo apt install nitrogen For Arch Linux\nsudo pacman -S nitrogen Picom Picom or formally known as Compton. is a compositor for your WM, its a fancy way of saying it handles all visual-related things in your session. For example, you can configure it to have shadows around your windows or have a blur effect on specific applications like a terminal.\nInstallation For Debian/Ubuntu\nsudo apt install picom For Arch Linux\nsudo pacman -S picom Conclution I hope you found these applications useful and I would love to hear your feedback on your favorite WM applications?\nAhmed Karim Links   📽 My YouTube Channel\n  📽 My Odysee Channel\n  🐦 My Twitter Profile\n  💻 My GitHub Profile\n  💼 My LinkedIn Profile\n  💰 My Patreon Page\n  ","date":"2021-10-16T18:08:32+05:00","image":"https://ahmed-al-balochi.github.io/post/wm-apps/wm.png","permalink":"https://ahmed-al-balochi.github.io/WM-Tools/","title":"5 Essential Tools for Window Managers"},{"content":"Intro These are incredible utilities that I have been using for a while now.

When you first install the app, it tells you that you need to evaluate your mental health by speaking to a mental health professional.  After evaluating your mental health, you can have a conversation a virtual AI that helps you to talk about your problems. This way you can always talk about your problems whether someone is available or not.  Cons  There are a lot of therapy sessions available in the app but most of them are locked, and you need to have a subscription to open them. The app won’t work until you have completed your mental health evaluation. While it\u0026rsquo;s really cool to talk to the AI about your problems, but you always feel like you are talking to an AI and not a real person.  Download Link  For Android Click Here For iOS Click Here  AI Dungeon AI Dungeon is just like what the title says. It’s a Role-Playing Game(RPG) that uses AI to handle your progress and choices inside the game. Pros  Excellent UI/UX design. Plenty of rich stories that are actually great. You can create your own character, you can choose its name, gender, race, class, where you start in the game(location), and you chose if your choices affect the whole game world which really makes it like a real game.  Cons  You can only interact with the game by writing text into a box, which can feel repetitive after a long session of gaming. You need to create an account to unlock most of the stories. The AI sometimes takes a bit to respond to your input.  Download Link  For Android Click Here For iOS Click Here  Hopper Hooper is an AI-based application that looks for the flights and cheapest hotel rooms around the year.\nPros  Excellent UI/UX design. it works by predicting the prices based on historic data. For example: you can search for a flight between any two cities and based on the historic data it displays all the cheapest months that have the lowest ticket prices. The same thing also applies to the hotel rooms. It gives a green color to the cheapest prices, and yellow for not so cheap prices, and red for high prices.  Cons  It\u0026rsquo;s only limited to hotels and flights and nothing else. And what I would like to see is that it supports other things like museums or restaurants based on the location that you provided. It\u0026rsquo;s also very bandwidth-heavy, so to have the best experience you need to have a good enough internet connection.  Download Link  For Android Click Here For iOS Click Here  Elsa Elsa is a great application for anyone to practice English and learn the language.\nPros  Has Excellent UI/UX design. It allows you to practice all the skills in order to become an excellent English speaker. It helps you develop your reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills.
